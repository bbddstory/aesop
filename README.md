# Aesop Shop

A front-end code test for consuming Aesop API.

The project was bootstrapped using Create React App in TypeScript, with Bulma for UI.

A reverse proxy was used for relaying requests to get around CORS restrictions. Please execute the following command in a terminal window:

### `npm run proxy`

Then wait until you see this message:

### `-- Reverse proxy running on port 5050`

## How to Start

In another terminal windows, install packages:

### `npm i`

Then start normally:

### `npm start`
